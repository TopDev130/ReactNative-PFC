## 2.1.0

Ahoy there! We've made PUSH even better, here's how:
[NEW] Venue labels - Quickly see which venues have offers running and help you get the best value drinks even faster!

[FIXED] We now default to delivery if it's available so just sit back and wait for your drinks.
[FIXED] The welcome banner sometimes outstayed it's welcome and it was really annoying. It now doesn't.
[FIXED] We've made a bucket load of optimisations to make things run even faster as we heard you don't like waiting?
[FIXED] Fonts and colours and logos oh my! We're added a few extra coats of paint to the app.
